Here is a collection Dockerfiles for use in building containers for Go AIs.
Include links to source and consult licenses.

Programs must support [GTP version 2][1], and must communicate over
`stdin`/`stdout` as the `CMD` in the Dockerfile. Dockerfiles should use
`cjlarose/baduk.io-base` as the base image. This is a barebones Debian Wheezy
image with only `build-essential` and `curl` installed.
